# SAT Math and Reading Scores by State

We are analyzing a dataset that has math and reading SAT scores in three states. There are `r n_rows` observations in our data. We are interested in whether there are differences between states in the avg math and reading scores on SAT. To test for these diff we ran a one-way ANOVA on reading scores with state (Minnesota, Maryland, and Texas) as the independent variable. This anova yielded a sig effect of state on reading scores, 
*F*(`r df_n`, `r df_d`) = `r f`, *p* < 0.001, $\eta$^2^ = `r es`.

```{r plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Summarize data
reading_by_state = sat_data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(mean_reading = mean(reading))

#Plot it
ggplot(data = reading_by_state, aes(x = state, y = mean_reading,
                                    fill = state)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', color = 'black')
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
